Some simple AI algorithms to work on for the xSlash game

This repo is to store and work on a few AI algorithms that were started and used to implement a very simple game.

For now algorithms are written in C# because the game was being developed in Unity 2D.

For any questions let me know or send me a message.

NOTE: These still need to be tested and worked on, but can be used as an idea.

Thanks,
